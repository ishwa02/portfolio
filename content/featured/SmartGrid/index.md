The smart grid integrates sensors and software into the existing grid to improve efficiency and sustainability, reducing reliance on fossil fuels. It faces challenges such as cybersecurity, client engagement, data management, and interoperability. This study proposes a PSO-based DSS model to manage and enhance smart grid efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, benefiting energy providers and users.
